### Hi there ðŸ‘‹




- ðŸ”­ I'm currently a junior student at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, majoring in Computer Engineering.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m broadly interested in Computer Architecture and System Software. More specifically, I'm interested in building tools/infrastructures for developers to do architecture designs more easily and efficiently, exploring the interaction and combination between software techniques and microarchitecture features.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m from Xi'an, Shaanxi, which is one of the oldest cities in China. In Xi'an, building a metro needs a professional archaeology team.
