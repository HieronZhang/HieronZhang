### Hi there ðŸ‘‹




- ðŸ”­ I'm currently a 2nd year CS PhD student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m broadly interested in Computer Architecture and System Software. More specifically, I'm interested in exploring the interaction and combination between software techniques and microarchitecture features, doing research in memory architecture for heterogeneous systems.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m from Xi'an, Shaanxi, which is one of the oldest cities in China. In Xi'an, building a metro needs a professional archaeology team.
